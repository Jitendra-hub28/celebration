            <h3>First Celebration</h3>

            <p>
                Welcome back to my world once again. This is a very special day for me to experience this Feb 14.
                You can say that “I won’t believe it.” I’d say, “No problem” 😅.
                I said no celebration, but not a crush list 😅😅😅.
                When I feel it, it won’t take much time to come out of that phase.
                I don’t want to make you feel bored, but I’ll say it in cut-copy-paste style.
            </p>

            <i style="color:black">ONE</i>
            <p>
                When I was in Class VII, there was a girl I had a crush on.
                Someone told her about me, and from that day onwards, she started calling me “BRO”.
                I didn’t even know what to do at that time.
                Later, she started calling me by my name again.
                One day, she introduced me to her sister, and everything was fine until one incident.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was roaming on the ground when her sister saw me.
                We spoke, and she asked me for chocolate.
                I gave her a chocolate that I had received from someone’s birthday.
                She told her sister that I gave her the chocolate.
                The next day, she came and warned me,
                “If you repeat this again, I’ll complain to the principal.”
                I was like 🤯.
                She didn’t even give me a chance to explain.
                And that’s where it ended.
            </p>

            <i style="color:black">TWO</i>
            <p>
                After that tragic incident, I lost my cool and started focusing on my sport (cricket).
                Bad luck hit me hard—I was not selected for the team,
                and my team lost the first match badly.
                Since every match was a knockout, that was the end.
            </p>

            <p>
                After completing my X and +2, in between,
                one Facebook friend got introduced into my life.
                We had a good time—not in person, only through chats.
                We fought, stopped talking, then started again.
                One day, she sent me her number,
                and I took one whole week to text her on WhatsApp.
            </p>

            <p>
                One day, I sent her three messages:
                <b>I</b> <b>...</b> <b>u</b>.
                She asked, “What is it?”
                I said, “Didn’t you get it?”
                She replied, “No.”
                I got pissed off.
                From July to December, we didn’t talk properly.
                Later, she said she was in a relationship with her brother-in-law.
                I was like, okay.
            </p>

            <p>
                On December 26, I was watching a BBL match,
                and suddenly I got a message:
                “This is my new number, delete the old one.”
                I was shocked.
                Her birthday was on December 30.
                From then onwards, she completely changed.
            </p>

            <p>
                She started teasing me, calling me, texting me,
                sharing everything wherever she went.
                Sometimes she used to say her boyfriend wasn’t talking to her.
                I used to get angry but replied normally.
                She shared her pictures and her niece’s pictures.
                Suddenly, she disappeared.
                This was in 2019.
                Since then, I never tried to look back.
            </p>

            <i style="color:black">THREE</i>
            <p>
                It took me 5 years and 4 months to feel the same way again.
                It was back in TCS Hyderabad, July 22, 2023.
                One look into those eyes hit me differently.
            </p>

            <p>
                I went to Hyderabad for CLP training.
                I was on the bench for 1.9 years, and then TCS started this program.
                On June 22, I went to the office.
                I didn’t even know she was in my batch
                because I was sitting in the last seats with my three amigos.
            </p>

            <p>
                After that, I started talking to her, and we developed good rapport.
                One day, she told me she got a match proposal
                and was about to meet him that weekend.
                I was in shock.
                The next Monday, I asked her about it.
                She said her father rejected it.
                She asked me why I was asking.
                I said casually, but inside I was very happy.
            </p>

            <p>
                On August 12, 2023, it was a long weekend.
                Around 50 members from all batches were there.
                We were talking normally when music started.
                I gave my Boat headset to her and played
                <mark>“HUKUM” from “JAILER”</mark>, a banger by <mark>Anirudh</mark>.
                She played <mark>“JAWAN: CHALEYA”</mark>
                and asked whether I liked it or not.
            </p>

            <p>
                I said, <mark>“Good.”</mark>
                She replied, <mark>“You didn’t get the lyrics, right?”</mark>
                I nodded my head, and she laughed.
                From there, we got very close,
                and I was ready to propose to her.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was listening to her favorite song <mark>“JAWAN: CHALEYA”</mark>.
                She is a big Chinese and K-drama lover.
                We were sitting opposite each other.
                During the 11:00–11:15 break, everyone went out except us.
                I was about to tell her, but I was extremely nervous and sweating.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even in that cool AC room, I was sweating.
                She noticed it.
                I went to the washroom, not knowing what to do.
                I took three days to confirm
                whether I was in love or just attracted.
                Later, I realized it was attraction.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the festival holidays, I never felt like I missed her.
                That confirmed it for me.
                I had never been with a woman like this before,
                so I understood my feelings and didn’t turn back.
                Even now, I don’t have her number.
            </p>

            <p style="color:">
                <mark>You know why I want to share this?
                Because I never felt the way when I was around you.
                I was with them except one but i never felt like missing them. But you???
                Normally, I don’t get bowled easily,
                but you took my wicket on the very first ball—
                clean bowled.</mark>
