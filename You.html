            <h3>Time with you</h3>
    <p>
         So, you know abot the whole first webpage. If not you can watch it again it is not deleted. You knew only 20% of the us story. now i'll say the 
         other 20% of the story but not much but a very little. Ohh I tried many ways to reach you and talk to you but I don't know I was scared. In your
         version I have a <mark>SOCIAL PHOBIA</mark> &#128513;. But the moment I love is being around you and feeling it. Sometimes we were in same outfit
         like maroon, black and green &#128517;&#128517;&#128517;.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes I get extra josh when you sees me back. I never talked to you but I use to feel the magic from you. On weeekends my work is to 
       <mark>"LISTEN MUSIC + LOOKING AT YOU"</mark> 😜😜😜. But what I missed is seeing you in a saree. But one thing I want share with you is, back in 
       the jaipur trip you posted a 3 pics with black outfit and background mountains. You just placed your hand on a dock, I wish I was beside you and
       looking each other. Also you have uploaded 13 pics in that 3rd pic I want to hold your hand and want to see you me like that 🙈🙈🙈. 
    </p>

    <p>
        After reading this please don't be mad. It's my imagination yaar, I can. Coming to the point I saw you in office many times but no talk only looks.
        The past you've known about me is not just normal it's the feel I missed from there and hard to leave. It's been 9-10 months since I've left you but
        hard to leave those little memories of you. I don't know whether it was accidental or coincidence we have our lunch date twice, in that you came,  
        now it's my turn to meet you and I'm waiting for that time. I'm completely leaving this to the destiny whether we'll meet for the third time or not.  
        but this time completely together.
    </p>

    <p>
        Last but not least, after READING this also please don't be <mark>"U-N-C-O-M-F-O-R-T-A-B-L-E"</mark> because i cannot take this again. I Know by 
        this time also you won't take the package because I said I'm giving you a precious one that's why you are denying it. I Knew it. I don't think if
        you wanna take also it won't be. Because my roomates will finish half of it. or else if it is still as it is you are lucky. Don't worry the 
        precious one is nothing but my <mark>"BATMAN HOTWHEEL TOY CAR"</mark>, I bought it in Thane Viviana Mall and that was the last piece I got and one
        guy asked to exchange this with another but I denied.  
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want you can take the package if not i'll send you my precious one. I won't give any of my toys to anyone but I'm giving it to you. Please
        handle with care. When we meet I'll take it. If you have that means my time will get to move much forward so that we meet very early. Till then 
        listen to my bangers and chill. I saw your pune trip stories and you have mentioned that your fav. marati song but I don't know. So till then
        please adjust with the violin background music. Don't worry I'm not posting any bangers. Remaining half of the 60% including all will tell you
        in person not like this or messages or calls. Whatever I saw then I want to look into your eyes and I'll say everything.
